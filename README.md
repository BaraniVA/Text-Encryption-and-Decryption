Usage

To use the program, run the text_encrypt_decrypt.py file and pass in the path to the text file you want to encrypt or decrypt and the encryption key:

python text_encrypt_decrypt.py (yourfile.txt)--key 'as per your requirements'

This will encrypt the text in (yourfile.txt) using the provided key and save the encrypted text to a new file called encrypted.txt

To decrypt the text, simply run the program again with the --decrypt option:
